    "Problem Description\n",
    "You are given a binary string B of length L which contains K ones and remaining zeros. You are required to place the K ones in the binary string in such a way that the longest consecutive zeros have the least length possible. Once such a binary string is constructed, you are required to print the length of the contiguous block of zeros, which has the largest length.\n",

    "B is of length 3 and it has 1 one's.\n",

    "So the possible strings as per the problem are 010, 001, 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first case, the maximum length of consecutive zeros is 1 whereas in the other two cases it is 2. Hence the constructed binary string is 010 and the output is 1.\n",

    "Explanation-\n",
    "\n",
    "B is of length 3 and it has all three one's. There is no block of zeros, hence the output is 0."
